        ,_size              //the size of the cargo (how many nodes it requires)
        ,_isWeapon          //if the cargo is a weapon (static weapon like a turret)
        ,_recoil            //the recoil of the weapon (if it is one)
    ],
    _modelBased             //if the output should use the model or the class name
] call A3A_Logistics_fnc_generateCargoOffset;

example output bellow, you can modify it as you'd like by for example adding a blacklist as shown, rest can be modified in the arguments of the function when the data is generated.
